# Decision_Trees_VS_Random_Forest 
For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).
Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. 
We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
We will be using Lending dataset from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
